I am a cybersecurity professional with a growing specialization in red teaming, risk management, and security operations. Through a hands-on internship in penetration testing, I contributed to real-world vulnerability assessments, responsible disclosure processes, and the development of technical reports. My experience spans key offensive security methodologies and vulnerability assessment practices, with a strong emphasis on ethical conduct and practical application. I am recognized for my ability to distill complex technical findings into clear, actionable insights that align with organizational security objectives. With a collaborative approach and strong communication skills, I am dedicated to supporting secure, resilient systems and contributing to high-performing security teams.

## Objective


To leverage my foundational experience in offensive security, risk management, and security operations in a dynamic cybersecurity roleâ€”ideally within a Security Operations Center (SOC) where I can contribute to threat detection, incident response, and continuous improvement of organizational security posture while expanding my technical and professional expertise.
