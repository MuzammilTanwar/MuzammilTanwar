My experience spans key offensive security methodologies and vulnerability assessment practices, with a strong emphasis on ethical conduct and practical application. I am recognized for my ability to distill complex technical findings into clear, actionable insights that align with organizational security objectives. With a collaborative approach and strong communication skills, I am dedicated to supporting secure, resilient systems and contributing to high-performing security teams.
